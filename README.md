# CoVital Mission 1

# THIS REPO HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED

The first leg in project Covital's mission is to provide a webapp through which people can self-monitor their symptoms.

## Installation for development

To set up this project in your pc, all you need is to clone/fork this repository and do

```
npm install
```

To run the project, type

```
npm run start
```

Eventually, a QR-code will appear, which you should scan using the [Expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en).

The app automatically synchronizes the code you write with the bundle on your phone, so most changes you do should reflect on the app almost immediately.

## Contribute!

This project needs people to work on it. If you have front-end experience, or wanna get some, feel free to look at the available issues. People will be actively monitoring them to answer any questions you might have.
